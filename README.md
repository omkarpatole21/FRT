# Problem Statement:

Books4U, an online book store, aims to provide a convenient platform for users to browse, purchase, and manage their book collections. However, current challenges include limited search functionality, inefficient book categorization, and a lack of personalized recommendations. Users often struggle to find specific books or discover new titles tailored to their preferences, leading to decreased user satisfaction and potential loss of sales. To address these issues, the Books4U project seeks to develop an enhanced online book store solution that offers robust search capabilities, improved categorization, and personalized book recommendations to enhance the overall user experience and drive sales growth.
